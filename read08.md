## SQL Bolt

#### SQL BOLT

[SQL BOLT](https://sqlbolt.com/) teaches us about SQL

Structured querry language is the way that we can access cormalized data from tables with specific commands to either update or simply call back table values back to the front end. 

While this is an introductory lesson in to SQL, my take away is that we need to remember that keywords and selectors (just like anything else), will help us tell the query what to do.

Also, the tables must contain certain unique vales, and the data is divided on to tables based on relations.
