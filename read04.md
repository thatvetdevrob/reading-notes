Why worry about crazy regular expression filtering when you can simply use a healpful tool and bypass actually learning it?

OR or ( || ), you can keep this in your mind and catch up to it when you hvae time, jst knowing that regular expression will help us when we encounter a word salad looking problem with a bunch of symbols, its usally a regular expression. 

Now, we dont like regular expression (as in there are a lot of js built in ecma fucntions to use already), but then, there a time and place for it's usage.
