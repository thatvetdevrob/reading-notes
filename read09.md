## Concepts of Functional Programming in Javascript

#### by TK

[TK tells us about functional programming](https://medium.com/the-renaissance-developer/concepts-of-functional-programming-in-javascript-6bc84220d2aa) teaches us about this concept begining by quoting wikipedia:

>"Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia"

Some of the ideasa are good: "pure" being the fact that input would not cause side effects (his pi example being a good mathematical one, and the random match a more easy to just understand), but how ould you allways avoid these kinds of fucntions? That would be inpractical...

I dont think that im at 'that level' to understand terms like recursion (which i think will make more sense wehn we study bubble sort and otehr searching big o notation related sorting algorithms), but it was a nice introduction to a radical idea of doing things for me, a junir dev.

## Refactoring JavaScript for Performance and Readability (with Examples!) 

#### by Andrew Healey

[Andrew Healey's article](https://dev.to/healeycodes/refactoring-javascript-for-performance-and-readability-with-examples-1hec) is anectdotal and talks about how to better write js for our back end purposes.

While not as lengthy as TK's i like his idea of writing programatic ways to change the random generated strings to friendly words, byt programatically using collections of terms to used instead of unreadable giberish: the idea being, no we dont wan everything available from our server to the front, but we can at least make the front more presentable, even when it comes to requests.
