## ** this is more of a disclaimer than anything: We already did pre work install, this is juts a tutorail to getting Heroku up and running. **

## Introduction

[This tutorial](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) will have you deploying a Node.js app to Heroku in minutes.

Hang on for a few more minutes to learn how to get the most out of the Heroku platform.

The tutorial assumes that you have a free Heroku account, and that you have Node.js and npm installed locally..

Heroku is an app centered platform: we arent really told what it is, but in the totorial we are basically showed how to deploy a prebuilt Heroku blog and read the logs.

When I looked up "What is Heroku?" i got this word salad:

"Heroku focuses relentlessly on apps and the developer experience around apps. Heroku lets companies of all sizes embrace the value of apps, not the distraction of hardware, nor the distraction of servers - virtual or otherwise."

For now the logs is pretty straight forward, and making an coount is a breeze. 

Also, to know i would say to keep in mind crt + c in windows stops the logs from going on.
