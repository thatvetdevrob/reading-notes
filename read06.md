## What Is Node and When Should I Use It?

#### by James Hibbard

[Our materials are](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) an article describing node.js in bitesize pieces to us. The best part of the article is the begining:

>"Hmmm, “event-based”, “non-blocking”, “asynchronous I/O” — that’s quite a lot to digest in one go. So let’s approach this from a different angle and begin by focusing on the other detail that both descriptions mention — the V8 JavaScript engine."

So we know: its a runtime enviroment: this means we can run the programs on our computer and not need the browser to do so.

Hibbard tells us about the node package manager, wich makes it so that we can reuse and download and save node packages to be reused or downloaded from a registry as needed.

In summary it is easy to say that node.js is going to be heavy in our js dev future (one thing i used is the angular CLI) but its best to further read in to it, as this is just a starting point, and we'd be doing ourselves a favor in the long run by becoming familiar with the subject of what node can do for us .
