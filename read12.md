Hansley's [article](https://medium.com/@henslejoseph/ejs-partials-f6f102cb7433) shows us how to reuse code and save time. 

Partials are a way to simply call back in blocks of code and put them where needed. This is a clever trick by companies to easily have multiple web builds and recycle them.

So by creating partials, and then calling upon them with a relative path we can go ahead and reuse a footer or nav bar.
