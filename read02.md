## JQuery

JQuery makes things that regular vanilla JS can do but it’s more compatible across all browsers and also friendlier to the programmer. Also it makes a lot of functionality work without the programmer using having to understand all of what’s going on.  


### Features of JQuerry

#### Easy to use

Jquery gives a lot of shortcuts to the user, the most obvious one being the shortening of JQuerry() to $(). 

#### No need to find work arounds

JQuery is compatible around all current browsers.

#### Easier to read

It is easier to read the CSS syntax of JQuerry, but it comes at the much written JS that has been done to give us the JQuery syntax.

JQuerry can be associated in to variables like regular JS variables. 

We can chain a JQuery with a dot selector. 

Because some looping functions are already built in, and some JS is provided for us more accessibly with JQuery, it’s important that as students, we are already familiar with JS, as much of the mystery of working with this new JS syntax will be resolved because our previous exercises. 

# Paierd PRogramming:

#### Code Fellows Believes in paired programming and gives six main points:

1. Greater efficiency

Greater efficiency means that when two programmers work together they can find better solutions faster, and makes the process more enjoyable.

2. Engaged collaboration

It prevents one programmer from goofing off.

3. Learning from fellow students

It allows students to be exposed to different ways of problem solving that they coulnt solve on their own. 

4. Social skills

This shows people can work together.

5. Job interview readiness

It helps students be ready for whiteboard interviews. 

6. Work environment readiness

Paired programming will help us hit the floor running in a work environment training mindset.
