Diversity is important, to prevent this reading assingment to be of just my opinion, im jsy going to summarize my thoughts about being a trans-non binary minority living in todays world but quoting [Mae Jamison](https://www.thoughtco.com/mae-jemison-quotes-3530131), who as the first black woman austronaut would have great insight about being a minority in her field:

# On Being Yourself

>"Sometimes people have already decided who you are without your story shining through."

>"The thing that I have done throughout my life is to do the best job that I can and to be me."

I wont let the opinions of others define how i see myself.
