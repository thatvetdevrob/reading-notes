Hansley's [article](https://medium.com/@henslejoseph/ejs-partials-f6f102cb7433) has a page dedicated to the subject of sending form data. 

It talks about the way the actions of a form sumtition are translate in to the client-server relationship to make sure the data is taken from the client to the back and able to be manipulated correctly.

The most important think to rememebr is that the vervs will do different things: GEt will not change a database but post will, because post is used to "create" while get is to retrieve.
