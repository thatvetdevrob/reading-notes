## What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

#### Charles Duhigg

[This story](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html) was something we read in 201, but its a lengthy and interesting read.

Basically thru the eyes of a woman who was part of two college "teams" of very different individuals notices thru her journey that when people can come together and be comfortable in communicating they are able to not only work together, but their emdevors can prosper beyond their involment. This is outlined in how a small reporposed room was and still might be till today a gym even long after the funding memebers are gone.

My communication style is very direct. I learned in the past week that i have to make sure that i work on my own interactions in what ways i can to match my counter parts to make them more comfortable. While reading the article i see that if i had to internalize its message, well how can i come togethere with individuals and make my team more comfortable.

I can listen more, as i tend to have a point of view and quickly pivot. I can also make sure i lower the speed of my voice and also make sure i relax more, and make sure that the harmony of the team is accounted just as much as the goal. Since we all have to continue on to many sprints together.

I look at my backgorund: military, long 24 hour shifts, high stress. I look at my upbringing: especial ed classes with focusing on cognitive behavior workshops and learning to mask my autims and work on my disabilities when talking to others. 

Finding a balance between working on myself, but not resenting myself for my social-interaction short comings is what i can take as a personal pointer and move forward. Like my especial education teachers in highschool used to teach me: its not about ever becoming normal, its about being the best posible version of myself, even if i fall short from time to time.

# Brookr: how i explained rest to my brother

This is an article where two brothers discus how rest is and the importance of verbs in our present and future code labs.

The verbs are the most important thing to remember. I remmeebr studying about them at some point in the past, and how they affected databases, but i had no idea i would encounter them now in a JS fullstack enviroment. 

I think i need more practical applications before i really come to understand rest.
